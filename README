Building AdChart:

debian machines should run ./configure to install project dependencies
java is also a dependency, and is not installed by the configure script


AdChart Binaries:

see commandline options adbot and url-injector

bin/selenium-server launches the virtual browser used by adbot
bin/url-injector pushes urls onto the Amazon SQS queue
bin/adbot pops urls off the Amazon SQS queue and processes them using the selenium server
bin/view-current-matches inserts an SQS message telling the adbot to process the current match data and generate a webpage


Running AdChart:

1. launch an instance of selenium-server
2. launch adbot, pointing it at the selenium server
3. inject some urls using url-injector
4. after a adbot has processed some urls, run view-current-matches
