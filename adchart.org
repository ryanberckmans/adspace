**** "we found IAD square on 3 of 5 sites"

*** bucket into campaigns/similar across all sites
**** "McDonald's launched a campaign 4 months ago, on these six websites, using these four ads, and dialed up frequency approximately 372% over 4 months"
*** bucket into competitive buckets
**** "The following four companies are competing for the banner ad on jj.com, and the top company receives the space 53% of the time"
*** estimating advertising budget on a per-site basis
**** 1. acquire ads, ad frequency, competitive buckets, etc
**** 2. have Mr. off-shore-resource inquire into advertising costs for that site
**** 3. calculate how much money each competitor is spending on advertising for that site
*** frequency data
**** "IAD square observed on 17 out of 20 url hits for qq.com, but only 5 out of 20 url hits for ww.com" => competitor bid higher for qq.com, or more competition on ww.com, etc

** TODO incorporate IAB sizes into iframe/flash detection ?
** TODO set up SQS/DB config for adbot using Justin's yaml/config model
** TODO do a better job of flattening logical ads, most likely by checking to see if they all go to same target location
** TODO buysellads - 'bsap', ads don't use adserver, great example of hardcoded ads problem
** TODO iframe - advertisements within iframes may get relative urls, need to prepend adserver domain for proper detection
e.g. nothing wrong with ad below, but we don't detect it because we detect link_url as "/pagead/..."

* larry notes
** what will/brad/bobby should have been thinking, and what we need to be thinking:
*** "previously unavailable" key-est statement we ever made: everyone and dog sellig tweaked pre-existing analytics
*** no limit to demand for better commercial intelligence of all kinds
*** customers need urgently, need will never diminish, nor will the urgency
*** need to set stage for the urgency and understand this fundamentally as it is initial part of our pitch
** high level strategy
*** big opportunity because of urgency, non-diminishing need, non-diminishing urgency
*** because of above, they will pay a "very large amount of money" "assuming they can't get it elsewhere..."
*** reaction of VCs/investors likely to be highly positive subject to caveats (which larry wll talk about below)
*** vulnerabilies:
**** barriers to entry
**** risk that someone has already begun to do it under radar
**** big companies that might be diong it and not telling world because use it privately instead
**** "google is not who I am concerned about"
**** global advertising companies (real ad agencies, revenues in billions, serve fortune 500/1000)
***** "to Ford: one of the reasons you stick with our firm is because we have [AdChart]"
***** once AdChart goes live, they may go live as an attack
***** they may even already have contingencies in place to go live if a competitor appears
**** at least one VC will think and follow through on the call "I wonder what advertising boys on Madison will think of this" .. and it will be the first thing in any experienced VC's head
*** we really need to find out if the global advertising firms are doing aynthing like this.  Need an advisor come ally with connections.
*** These global ad agencies are our most logical customers come allies
*** =->> it is not clear we need a vc
*** don't fail to look at all the alternatives
*** what we have proposed (VC) is a very orthodox way to fund a tech venture. very special venture, might not be right model
*** one alternative: globl ad agency customer, investor, ally.  We get in bed with gorilla and double his size
*** recommendation: dont look at financing in a single way
*** recommendation: we are adding to risk by meeting with lots of VC
*** if there is no competition, significnat idea. If not, still great, not being managed well at either level
*** clearly the VCs we are talking to dont know of any competition

* larry notes post
** problem: need customer
** solution: global ad agencies actively engaged in sale of competitive information
** problem: need to know if competition exists
** solution: global ad agencies most likely to know of AdChart competition
** how to contact global ad agency?
** ad agency has office in toronto
** Rogers actively engaged in competitive multimedia, and can open any door in Toronto
** UoT/York profs in Marketing/Biz do industry consulting, and have connections to ad agency offices in toronto
** first meeting with ad agency: mini demo, 5 minute presentation, "we are seeking an ally"  "we understand there are many different ways this could unfold"
** second meeting with ad agency (more of their people): larger demo, questions, "would you like to work with us" "how do you envision this unfolding" " ... alternatives exist"
** if they want to work with us, hire lawyer / high level CA type immediately. Seek funding to pay for it, should be total snap because "we are about to enter into an agreement with global ad agency"
** if things dont work out with first ad agency, use knowledge to refine. continue with ad agencies and branch out to other channels such as major websites
** all the meanwhile, develop product
** once we have major customer such as ad agency, if the customer didn't already fund us, seek out funding in the millions
** problem: Bobby too junior. Keep him on board to held in advisor role, but he needs to take a back seat.  Lots of evidence how junior he is from slackjaw manner he has dealt with strategy/VCs.
** problem: herd of VCs. Cancel thursday meeting "key player unable to attend", Cancel incubation meeting


* ad detection notes
** limitations with url detection
*** some advertisements simply don't have adserver urls. they are direct links to target location.
