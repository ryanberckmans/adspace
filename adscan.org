I think that I should explain why Stats Empire doesn't have a trace of an online presence.
First, we have been full time for about 2 weeks. We had, originally, decided to bootstrap Stats Empire. Since then we have been flooded with client work. Since neither one of us is a graphic/web designer, we couldn't whip up a website quickly, and we wouldn't have had time even if we had the skills. 

** Founders
Name, education, work experience (incl. present employer), personal URL

Zach Aysan
Structural Engineering, University of Waterloo
Nominated for Co-op Student of the year (2007), multiple "Outstanding" co-op evaluatoins
Hacker since the age of 6.

Relevent work experience
Junior Software Developer, 3 years, Elabs Inc (a software consultancy)
Worked on a classified project called the Pegasus Program for the NSA, FBI, CIA, and state Sherrif's offices.

Market Intelligence, 1.5 years, FreshBooks (largest online invoicing company)
In charge of analytics and reporting. A blend of programming, business sense, and statistics was used to maximize conversion rates through the customer aquisition funnel as well as to optimize advertizing campaigns. Open sourced a gtest calculator at http://github.com/zachaysan/Split-Test-with-the-G-Test.

Ryan Berckmans
ryan.berckmans@gmail.com 
Computer Science, University of Waterloo
Multiple "Outstanding" co-op evaluations at Amazon.com

Relevent work experience
Software Development Engineer Intern, 9 months, Amazon.com

Lead Developer, 8 months, software web consulting startup (a summer project)

Co-op Programmer, 1 year, Silicon Knights Inc
Duties evolved from junior tasks to being the foremost developer and expert on some critical modules for a blockbuster Xbox360 game.

** Achievements
Why are you and your team so kick-ass
We're extremely smart, hardworking, outgoing, and friendly. 

Ryan was among 20 students to receive offers from Amazon.com, from an applicant pool of over 200. 
Of the 20 students hired, less than 25% received the top rating of Outstanding. 
Ryan was offered a second internship and received a subsequent Outstanding.
This places Ryan in the top percent of Waterloo Computer Science students, as measured by a Fortune 500 ecommerce technology company.

** Product
What is the product, the market size, painkiller/vitamin, the problem it solves, demo/video URL
Stats Empire aims to build multiple products. Prototypes for each product have been hacked together and a working alpha version of the first product has been completed. 
The first product is something we codenamed AdScan. This is where we will focus our time during the incubation program.

AdScan crawls through the internet and organizes where people buy banner ad space. By keeping track of how long businesses advertizes on a site a relative measure of a specific banner ad's effectiveness can be ascertained. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP) companies are automatically grouped into groups of competitors. So, for example, Microsoft is a competitor with both Apple and Nintendo, but Apple is not a competitor with Nintendo.

Online advertizing is a numbers game. A company spends $200k to find out the $150k they should completely throw out, by allowing our clients a view into where their competitors are advertising we allow them to save on the exploritory portion of their advertising spend. Unlike key word advertising, banner ad advertising requires the advertiser to decide on a per website basis where to invest. 
** Innovation
What is different about what you are doing
We are 

** Prototype
Have you already started working on a prototype, who wrote the code, who owns the code

Yes, our prototype is amazing, purely backend for now, but it is awesome anyways.  

We wrote the code (except for some standard open source libraries). 

We own the code. 
** Technology
Open/closed source, stack, interesting problems and solutions, why no one can copy this

Open source stack. Blend of Ruby and Python (Ruby for bindings to Selenium, Python for access to the SciPy libraries). 
Linux operating system, plan on expanding to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the near future. 

Interesting problems: 

Ads are often rendered or tracked in Javascript or Flash so we needed to have access to a programmable browser in order to properly sort and scan target websites. By using Selenium we are able to get around that problem. 

Our server is going to be busy, very busy. By using AWS we can:
1. Store a ton of banner ad images for generated/customized reports.
2. Fire up many, many servers to scan the whole internet without having to serially wait for each page to render. 

Why nobody can copy this: People are going to try, but in the end most developers do not have: 
1. A solid understanding of how the online advertising industry works.
2. The technical knowhow on how to properly render the advertising.
3. A development speed measured in km/s. 

Knockoffs will not be able to keep up with our output rate. As we grow we will release multiple products, like compete.com and 37 Signals to build off our current user base. 
** Revenue
How is it going to make money
This app will make money by:
1. Charging people for the information. 
2. Getting a referral fee from the blogs we direct our clients to.

** Competition *
Who is the competition, how big are they
There are many players in the intelligence space, but we have first
mover advantage for the banner ad space. Eventually we hope to
strongly compete with some of Accenture's offerings, but for the time
being this is a new space. 

** Experience *
What have you done/built in the past, how do you know your other
founders, have you worked with your founders before

** Knowledge *

What is different about your approach, what do you know that others do not, what unique experience does your team have
Zach Aysan knows how online marketing and advertising work, while
still being able to code. His experience optimizing advertizing
campaigns and setting up and running split tests will mean that he is
able to bring tools and information to Stats Empire's clients that are
worth buying. It also means that he knows how to market 
** Exit *
What sort of exit do you eventually expect (IPO, acquisition, other)
We are not planning on exiting. We think that we can
make enough money to stand on our own. Profitable companies get large
offers. We hope to turn down many large offers. An IPO or share buy
back would probably be the most likely outcome.
** Moats *
What sort of barriers block others from following you (patents, unique information, first mover advantage)
We could take the time to patent some of our processes and, of course,
software, but since people are buying information that wouldn't be an
effective method of stopping competitors. 

The true moat that stops knock-off competitors is creating a really
polished app that is hard to compete with and developing at a rate
that others could not match. 

We plan on being successful enough to where others start trying to
copy us. Once we are there we will continue to create great
intelligence apps for online businesses. 

** Commitment *

Can all the founders work on this full time, how about after the
program?

** Other 
Why should we invest in you
You should invest in us because we solve problems for businesses.
You should invest in us because we are nice, hardworking, smart guys. 
You should invest in us because We will be a major name in the Toronto
tech scene allowing you to attract more startups to fund.
You should invest in us because we know online marketing, but don't
have the overhead of a business-y guy that can't code. 
You should invest in us because we will make you money.
